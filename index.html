    <br> <h2>Introduction and History to Basketball</h2> </br>
    <p>Basketball is a sport played by many people around the world. It can be played in multiple ways with however many people you want. However, the most well-known way to play basketball is organized basketball. In organized basketball, you play with two teams of five on a rectangular court, indoors or outdoors. Positions only really matter in certain cases but there are 5 positions. There's a: </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Point guard that makes plays</li>
        <li>Shooting guard that scores primarily by shooting the ball and gets steals on defense</li>
        <li>Small Forward that scores and plays defense</li>
        <li>Power Forward that does the job of a center but isn't constrained by staying near the basket</li>
        <li>Center that guards and scores on the tallest players on the courts near the basket</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The objective of this sport is to score more points than the other team by throwing the ball into a ten foot basket. This is done in a plethora of ways such as layups, midrange shots, three-point shots, and free throws.</p>
    <p>The history of basketball started like this. In the winter of 1891-1892, James Naismith was tasked with teaching a gym class of college students at the International YMCA Training School (now known as Springfield College). The type of things they did in that gym class were usually boring. Naismith was put to this class so that he could create a game that would be easy to execute, complex enough to be interesting, playable in any environemnt with a large number of people at once, and help the college students burn off their energy without the risk of injury. Naismith would use many different games for inspiration such as lacrosse and soccer, and set out to create the game. He ended up getting two peach baskets and nailed them at either side of the gym at the balcony. He would create the original 13 rules for the game and the goal was to throw a ball into the peach basket to score points. The next time the class met, the game was introduced and basketball was born. Over the years, the game would spread and evolve, evnetually becoming what it is today. </p>

    <br> <h2>Aspects of basketball</h2> </br>
    <p>There are many different things involved when you are playing basketball. You need to know how to dribble, rebound, shoot, drive, play defense, set screens, and more. You need to know the rules and how to follow them so you don't cause a violation, such as traveling, and lose a possession for your team to score. </p>
    <br> <h2>Professional Leagues</h2> </br>
    <p>There are many professional leagues around the world for basketball. These leagues are often in different countries such as EuroLeague (the top-tier league for Europe) and the CBA (The Chinese Basketball Association). However, the most popular and coveted league of all is the NBA in North America, comprised of 30 teams of the best players in the world.</p>
